IC2 Crops Tools
===============

Interactive tools for understanding crops
from the mod IndustrialCraft2 for Minecraft 1.7.10.

Data is taken from the modpack [GT: New Horizons](https://github.com/GTNewHorizons/GT-New-Horizons-Modpack),
but the mechanics should be the same as vanilla IC2.


Development
===========

The "raw" biome data in `src/BiomeData.ts` is autogenerated.
NEI can produce a data dump in CSV format of all the biomes.
The following command-line incantation formats the CSV file into Javascript code:
```
    csvformat --delimiter ',' --quotechar '"' --out-delimiter '|' biome.csv | sed 's/, /", "/g' | sed 's/\([^|]*\)|\([^|]*\)[^|]*|[^|]*|\([^|]*\)|[^|]*|[^|]*|[^|]*|\([^|]*\)|\([^|]*\)/{id: \1, name: "\2", rainfall: \3, types: ["\4"], class: "\5"},/'
```
